Install in your project: `npm install react-undraw-illustrations --save`

At the top of your React component, import the illustrations you want to use:

`import {UndrawTabs, UndrawDesigner,UndrawResponsive } from 'react-undraw-illustrations';`

Then use them, passing settings you like, e.g:

`<UndrawDesigner skinColor="brown" hairColor="#222"/>`

# Preparing the NPM package

I followed this guide to prepare the NPM package: https://medium.com/@lokhmakov/best-way-to-create-npm-packages-with-create-react-app-b24dd449c354

When running `yarn run lib`, it's supposed to copy the components from `/src/node_modeules/components` to `/lib/components/`.

Also, you need to **make sure** any new components are also present in `/src/node_modules/index.js`, and run `yarn run lib`!

I did this with this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFosgYpt4JHZgg7JMnISlz8c9Q8CxrGVubJC6VKnZQY/edit?usp=sharing) haha!
